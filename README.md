User Guides
============
1- The project consists of two parts: 

    1-1- Web part
  
    1-2- REST API part

**1-1 Web part:**
      
      a. users have to register 
      
      b. THE FIRST USER WHO RWGISTERS WILL BE KNOWN AS ADMIN. (column roles is implemented inside the user table)
      
      c. PLEASE NOTE THAT ONLY ADMIN CAN DO THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS:
      
           I)   CREATE GROUP 

           II)  DELETE GROUP
           
                 a. onlly groups with no members can be deleted.

           III) ADD USER TO A GROUP

           IV)  REMOVE USER FROM A GROUP

           V)   DELETE USER
        
 **1-2 REST API part:**  
      
        a.  In the registration process a unique token is created for each user in order to identify the senders of the REST requests.
        
            I)   token is stored in token column of the user table 
            
            II)  Each user can see only his/her own token in the user list of web version
            
            // TODO  separte table with the userId column, user token column, and also expiration time column must be implemented, etc.
        
        b.  REST REQUESTS MUST START WITH /api/. Such as the followign sample url:
        
            `HOMEURL/api/RESTREQUEST`
            
        c.  admin token must be send as a token parameter for the REST requests. 
        
            `example: HOMEURL/api/deleteUser?token=sadff&userId=2`
            
        d.  the following shows the list of valid REST API Requests:
        
            I)    create user: `HOMEURL/api/createUser?token=****&name=***&email=****&password=****`
            
            II)   delete user:  `HOMEURL/api/deleteUser?token=****&userId=***`
            
            III)  view user list:  `HOMEURL/api/viewUsers?token=****`
            
            IV)   create group:  `HOMEURL/api/createGroup?token=****&title=`
            
            V)    delete group:  `HOMEURL/api/deleteGroup?token=****&groupId=`
            
            VI)   view group members:  `HOMEURL/api/viewGroupUsers?token=****&groupId=` 
            
            VII)  add user to a group: `HOMEURL/api/viewGroupUsers?token=****&groupId=` 
            
            VIII) view group list `HOMEURL/api/groupList?token=****` 
            
            IX)   delete a user from a group  `HOMEURL/api/deleteUserFromGroup?token=****&userId=***andGroupId=****`
